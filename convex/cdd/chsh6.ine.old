* Compiled for Rational Exact Arithmetic with GMP
*Input File:chsh6.ext(144x17)
*HyperplaneOrder: LexMin
*Degeneracy preknowledge for computation: None (possible degeneracy)
*Hull computation is chosen.
*Computation starts     at Mon Jan 10 15:36:36 2011
*            terminates at Mon Jan 10 15:36:36 2011
*Total processor time = 0 seconds
*                     = 0h 0m 0s
*Since hull computation is chosen, the output is a minimal inequality system
*FINAL RESULT:
*Number of Facets = 0
H-representation
begin
0  17  rational
end
*Input Error: The polytope (convex hull) is not full dimensional.
