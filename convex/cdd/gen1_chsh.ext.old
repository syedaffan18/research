* Compiled for Rational Exact Arithmetic with GMP
*Input File:gen1_chsh.ine(65x21)
*HyperplaneOrder: LexMin
*Degeneracy preknowledge for computation: None (possible degeneracy)
*Vertex/Ray enumeration is chosen.
*Computation completed at Iteration 66 because the region found empty.
*Computation starts     at Wed Jan 12 17:42:04 2011
*            terminates at Wed Jan 12 17:42:05 2011
*Total processor time = 1 seconds
*                     = 0h 0m 1s
*FINAL RESULT:
*Number of Vertices =0, Rays =0
