*------ Labs -------*
lab2  -> Recursion
lab3  -> Binary tree (Complete. Insert eats up a node)
lab4  -> Btree (Not complete)
lab5  -> RBtree (Not complete, finished in ass2)
lab6  -> HashTable (Almost complete, finished in ass3)
lab7  -> SkipLists (Insert Remains)
lab8  -> Heap with Insert Implemented
lab9  -> BTrie (Only the beginning)

prelabs are self-explanatory.
